# Source bug fixes and audit

Engineering policy: [Sanitized Parity](docs/engineering/SANITIZED-PARITY.md).
Started 2026-10-23. **Open items below are not fixed or verified claims.**
Earlier passing tests may encode defects; test totals are not a safety certificate.

## Verified fixes

### FSB-002: Require a real Hairface storage owner

- Source/local owner: `LegacyNativeHairfaceStorageRuntime` constructor; the old
  implementation accepted null and `Add` later faulted after publishing an item.
- Corrected invariant: reject null immediately with `ArgumentNullException(client)`;
  retain the actual client as a readonly owner. Tests use real native client owners.
- Verification: Release focused Hairface storage/login and character-read tests:
  **173 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped** (2026-10-23, local offline run).
- Limits: does not yet fix loader partial publication, exposed mutable rows,
  foreign-owner login reuse, equipment validation or all mutation/send failures.
  No live client, original save or SQL was used. Commit is recorded in Git history.

## Active audit

| ID | Defect / affected owner | Required invariant | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FSB-001 | CanUseSpell spends stamina/mana and mutates authorization/soul before late rejection; exposes rows on false | Validate and prepare first; rejection is side-effect free; serialize competing admissions | Implementation in progress |
| FSB-002 | Hairface storage retains null owner and fails later | Reject invalid owner at construction; valid ownership remains stable | Constructor fixed; adjacent storage audit remains |
| FSB-003 | Guild donation narrows uint to signed int, allowing a wallet credit | Positive bounded amount; wallet/fund/donation commit together | Open, not integrated |
| FSB-004 | League receiver uses a recycled packet after its wrapper was disposed | Keep exclusive packet ownership through final use | Open, joint graph held |
| FSB-005 | Trade/booth/inventory disconnect, duplicate UID and retry windows | Validated atomic/idempotent transfer with durable reconciliation | Full audit required |
| FSB-006 | SQL multi-row save/load and native eager lifecycle are incomplete | Real transaction boundaries, constraints and recovery proof | Open |
| FSB-007 | Guild/league/title/catalog loaders publish partial state; file saves rewrite in place | Stage valid state; coherent publication and recoverable file replacement | Implementation/audit in progress |
| FSB-008 | Name-based GM/PM privileges and inconsistent title4001 equip/remove classification | Server-owned authority and validated consistent title metadata | Implementation/audit in progress |
| FSB-009 | Rewards record claim/MAC before grants; partial failure loses claim; IP/MAC indexing differs | Validate full reward; atomic/idempotent claim and grant; correct identity checks | Open, reward execution held |
| FSB-010 | Guild/league lookups, appointment bounds and caller-selected guild IDs lack validation | Validate request, role, capacity and own-guild authority before effects | Implementation/audit in progress |

## CodeFactor cleanup

Authorized alongside behavioral repairs. The public report was retrieved on
2026-10-23: grade A, 2,327 findings across 4,864 files. Category counts: complexity
822; duplication 196; performance 106; maintainability 1,203. This is a snapshot,
not proof that every reported issue has been inspected.

Two reported CA1827 findings in Hairface storage are addressed locally: existence
uses `Any`, and catalog resolution uses one `FirstOrDefault` instead of counting
then repeating the lookup. Remote reanalysis is still required to confirm closure.

No blanket warning suppression or exclusion is authorized. An A grade is not
gameplay completion; retain behavior and protocol tests through quality refactors.
